# firebase-customer-counter

A firebase implementation of a customer counting app

the goal was to create a rough setup to allow multiple clients to modify the same counter value at the same time.

If there is demand and I have some spare time, I will add a simple, clean dashboard screen so the current visitor count can be displayed.
